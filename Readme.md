# 🌟 Hey there, I'm Jhon Paul Baonil 👋

I'm a **junior web developer** who loves mixing **creativity** and **technology** to bring ideas to life.  
I’m not a “100% manual coder” yet — I often use AI tools like **Kiro** and **ChatGPT** to speed up my workflow — but I make sure every project I ship is clean, responsive, and functional.  
To me, AI isn’t a shortcut, it’s a **power tool** that helps me learn faster and build smarter.
